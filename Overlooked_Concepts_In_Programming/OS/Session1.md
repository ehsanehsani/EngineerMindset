# Session 1: Essential Concepts for Programmers Often Overlooked

This article is a comprehensive expansion and re-organization of the core notes from my first technical session with my mentor [Vahid](https://github.com/pylover) , aimed at covering fundamental operating system and low-level programming concepts that many developers may not have learned deeply. The goal is to build a solid foundation for writing portable, robust, and efficient software.

## 1. POSIX: The Standard for Portability

**POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)** is a set of standards designed to ensure compatibility between Unix-like operating systems.

- **Purpose:** If a program adheres to POSIX standards, it should run with little or no modification on various systems such as Linux, macOS, or *BSD.
- **Portability:** Programs written to be POSIX-compliant are portable—they can be executed on multiple systems with minimal hassle.
- **Examples:**
  - **Vim:** A highly portable text editor available on most Unix-like platforms.
  - **Bash and Shell:** Perhaps the most portable programs, available almost everywhere.
- **Windows and POSIX:** Windows is famously not POSIX-compliant. For example, Windows is not case-sensitive with file and folder names, which can cause problems when transferring files from POSIX systems.

## 2. Core Responsibilities of an Operating System

The most critical role of an operating system (OS) is **resource allocation**, with memory management being paramount.

- **Memory Allocation and Reclamation:**
  - Each process must release any RAM it has claimed when it finishes.
  - Failure to do so results in a **memory leak**, which can degrade system performance over time.

---

## 3. Memory Leak: Definition and Explanation

A **memory leak** occurs when a program allocates memory (for example, using `malloc()` in C or a similar mechanism in other languages) but fails to release it back to the operating system or memory manager after that memory is no longer needed. This means that the memory remains reserved and unavailable for future use, even though the program itself can no longer access or utilize it.

**Key Points:**
- **Resource Loss:** The leaked memory is effectively "lost" to both the application and the system until the process terminates.
- **Progressive Impact:** If a program repeatedly leaks memory, over time it will consume more and more RAM. This can result in slower performance, system instability, or even a crash if system memory is exhausted.
- **Critical for Long-Running Programs:** Memory leaks are especially dangerous in software intended to run for long periods (such as servers or background services), as the effects accumulate.
- **Detection:** Specialized tools like `valgrind` on Linux are commonly used to detect memory leaks during development and testing.

**Example in C:**
```c
void foo() {
    int *ptr = malloc(100 * sizeof(int));
    // ... use ptr ...
    // Forgot to call free(ptr); here — memory is leaked!
}
```

**Summary:**  
When a process finishes its work, it should release any RAM it claimed. If it does not—meaning it loses all references to the allocated memory without properly freeing it—this is called a **memory leak**.

## 4. Running Linux on Windows: WSL

To experience Linux within Windows, you can use **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

- **Installation:**
  ```sh
  wsl --install
  ```
- **Launching a Distribution:**
  - Search for Ubuntu in Windows or run:
    ```sh
    wsl -d Ubuntu
    ```
  - Multiple Linux distributions can coexist (e.g., one used by Docker), so be specific.

- **Essential Build Tools:**
  Within the Linux environment, install crucial development packages:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install build-essential
  ```
  - **`build-essential`** is a meta-package that includes:
    - `gcc`: C compiler
    - `g++`: C++ compiler
    - `make`: Tool for running Makefiles
    - `libc6-dev`: Standard C libraries and headers
    - Other foundational tools necessary for compiling software from source

## 5. Documentation: The `man` Command

The `man` (manual) command is indispensable for reading documentation.

- **Usage:**
  ```sh
  man man
  ```
  - This opens the manual page for the `man` command itself.
- **Pro Tip:** Get in the habit of thoroughly reading Unix/Linux documentation. Unlike some other platforms (e.g., Microsoft), Unix man pages are usually concise and highly informative.
- **Example: `malloc` Man Page Highlights**
  ```
  malloc() allocates size bytes and returns a pointer. The memory is not initialized.
  If size is 0, malloc() returns a unique pointer for later use with free().
  ```
  - **Details:** `size` refers to the number of bytes to allocate. The returned memory is uninitialized and may contain leftover data.
- **Navigation:** When viewing a man page (opened in `vim` by default), use `/` to search and `n` to move to the next occurrence.

## 6. Understanding Processes and I/O Streams

**Processes** interact with the outside world primarily through three standard streams:

- **Standard Input (`stdin`):** Receives input data.
- **Standard Output (`stdout`):** Sends output data.
- **Standard Error (`stderr`):** Sends error and warning messages.

These streams are treated as open files, operating as data streams (not physical files).

- **Signals:** Additionally, processes can communicate asynchronously with the OS or other processes using **signals**. These are used for notifications, control, and state management (e.g., termination, pausing).
- **Shared Memory** Processes also can communicate with the OS using Shared Memory (Advanced Topic)

### Example: Sending Signals

- **Ctrl+C:** Sends a signal to Bash to terminate the running process.

---

## 7. The Shell: Interface Between User and Kernel

A **shell** is a program that mediates between the user and the operating system kernel.

- **Role:** Accepts user commands, processes them, and passes them to the kernel for execution.
- **Bash:** One of the most popular shells, offering advanced features.
- **Analogy:** Shell is like a machine; Bash is a specific model of that machine.

---

## 8. Zombie Processes

A **zombie process** is one that has finished executing but has not been fully cleaned up by the system.

- **Lifecycle:**
  - Upon completion, the OS preserves information (PID, exit status, run time) so the parent can retrieve it using `wait()`.
  - If the parent fails to collect this information, the process remains a zombie—dead but not yet removed.
- **Risks:** Zombies use minimal resources but can fill up the process table and prevent new processes from being created if left unchecked.
- **Cleanup:** The parent process should "reap" its children. If not, the kernel may assign `init` or `systemd` as the new parent to perform cleanup.

---

## 9. Signals and the `kill` Command

**Signals** are brief, asynchronous messages sent to processes by the OS or users.

- **Common Signals:**
  - `SIGTERM` (15): Polite request to terminate
  - `SIGKILL` (9): Forceful, non-ignorable termination
  - `SIGSTOP`: Temporarily pause
  - `SIGCONT`: Continue after a pause
  - `SIGHUP`: Reload configuration

- **Signal Properties:**
  - Each signal has a name and a number.
  - Processes can handle signals via default behavior or custom handlers.
  - Some signals are ignorable (`SIGTERM`), others are not (`SIGKILL`, `SIGSTOP`).

- **Sending Signals:**
  - **Via `kill`:**
    ```sh
    kill -9 1234
    ```
    - Sends signal 9 (`SIGKILL`) to process with PID 1234, forcing immediate termination.
  - **Other Usage:** Kill is a generic command for sending any signal, not just termination.

## 10. Bash: The Ubiquitous Shell

- **Why Bash?** Bash is available nearly everywhere and is highly portable.
- **Terminal Interaction:** Bash itself is a process, using standard input/output for communication.
- **Unix Philosophy:** "Everything is a file." This enables powerful command chaining and redirection.
  - **Piping:** Connect commands together:
    ```sh
    ls | grep bin
    ```
    - Sends output from `ls` as input to `grep`.
  - **Redirection:**
    ```sh
    ls > bar
    ```
    - Redirects output from `ls` to the file `bar`.

## 11. The Structure of Man Pages

Man pages in Unix/Linux are divided into **nine sections**, each serving a specific purpose:

| Section | Description                                              | Examples                                     |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1       | User Commands (executed by users)                       | `ls`, `mkdir`                                |
| 2       | System Calls (directly by kernel)                       | `open()`, `read()`                           |
| 3       | C Library Functions                                     | `printf()`, `malloc()`                       |
| 4       | Special Files and Devices                               | `/dev/null`, `/dev/random`                   |
| 5       | File Formats and Configuration Files                    | `/etc/passwd`                                |
| 6       | Games and Screensavers                                  | (historical, rarely used now)                |
| 7       | Miscellaneous (macros, standards, conventions)          | `regex`, `signal`                            |
| 8       | System Administration Commands (root/admin tools)       | `mount`, `iptables`, `reboot`                |
| 9       | Kernel Routines (for kernel/module development)         | (not always available on all systems)        |
