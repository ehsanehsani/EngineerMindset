# Session 1: Essential Concepts for Programmers Often Overlooked

This article is a comprehensive expansion and re-organization of the core notes from my first technical session, aimed at covering fundamental operating system and low-level programming concepts that many developers may not have learned deeply. The goal is to build a solid foundation for writing portable, robust, and efficient software.

## 1. POSIX: The Standard for Portability

**POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)** is a set of standards designed to ensure compatibility between Unix-like operating systems.

- **Purpose:** If a program adheres to POSIX standards, it should run with little or no modification on various systems such as Linux, macOS, or *BSD.
- **Portability:** Programs written to be POSIX-compliant are portable—they can be executed on multiple systems with minimal hassle.
- **Examples:**
  - **Vim:** A highly portable text editor available on most Unix-like platforms.
  - **Bash and Shell:** Perhaps the most portable programs, available almost everywhere.
- **Windows and POSIX:** Windows is famously not POSIX-compliant. For example, Windows is not case-sensitive with file and folder names, which can cause problems when transferring files from POSIX systems.

## 2. Core Responsibilities of an Operating System

The most critical role of an operating system (OS) is **resource allocation**, with memory management being paramount.

- **Memory Allocation and Reclamation:**
  - Each process must release any RAM it has claimed when it finishes.
  - Failure to do so results in a **memory leak**, which can degrade system performance over time.

## 3. Running Linux on Windows: WSL

To experience Linux within Windows, you can use **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

- **Installation:**
  ```sh
  wsl --install
  ```
- **Launching a Distribution:**
  - Search for Ubuntu in Windows or run:
    ```sh
    wsl -d Ubuntu
    ```
  - Multiple Linux distributions can coexist (e.g., one used by Docker), so be specific.

- **Essential Build Tools:**
  Within the Linux environment, install crucial development packages:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install build-essential
  ```
  - **`build-essential`** is a meta-package that includes:
    - `gcc`: C compiler
    - `g++`: C++ compiler
    - `make`: Tool for running Makefiles
    - `libc6-dev`: Standard C libraries and headers
    - Other foundational tools necessary for compiling software from source

## 4. Documentation: The `man` Command

The `man` (manual) command is indispensable for reading documentation.

- **Usage:**
  ```sh
  man man
  ```
  - This opens the manual page for the `man` command itself.
- **Pro Tip:** Get in the habit of thoroughly reading Unix/Linux documentation. Unlike some other platforms (e.g., Microsoft), Unix man pages are usually concise and highly informative.
- **Navigation:** When viewing a man page (opened in `vim` by default), use `/` to search and `n` to move to the next occurrence.

- **Example: `malloc` Man Page Highlights**
  ```
  malloc() allocates size bytes and returns a pointer. The memory is not initialized.
  If size is 0, malloc() returns a unique pointer for later use with free().
  ```
  - **Details:** `size` refers to the number of bytes to allocate. The returned memory is uninitialized and may contain leftover data.

## 5. Understanding Processes and I/O Streams

**Processes** interact with the outside world primarily through three standard streams:

- **Standard Input (`stdin`):** Receives input data.
- **Standard Output (`stdout`):** Sends output data.
- **Standard Error (`stderr`):** Sends error and warning messages.

These streams are treated as open files, operating as data streams (not physical files).

- **Signals:** Additionally, processes can communicate asynchronously with the OS or other processes using **signals**. These are used for notifications, control, and state management (e.g., termination, pausing).

### Example: Sending Signals

- **Ctrl+C:** Sends a signal to Bash to terminate the running process.

## 6. The Shell: Interface Between User and Kernel

A **shell** is a program that mediates between the user and the operating system kernel.

- **Role:** Accepts user commands, processes them, and passes them to the kernel for execution.
- **Bash:** One of the most popular shells, offering advanced features.
- **Analogy:** Shell is like a machine; Bash is a specific model of that machine.

---

## 7. Zombie Processes

A **zombie process** is one that has finished executing but has not been fully cleaned up by the system.

- **Lifecycle:**
  - Upon completion, the OS preserves information (PID, exit status, run time) so the parent can retrieve it using `wait()`.
  - If the parent fails to collect this information, the process remains a zombie—dead but not yet removed.
- **Risks:** Zombies use minimal resources but can fill up the process table and prevent new processes from being created if left unchecked.
- **Cleanup:** The parent process should "reap" its children. If not, the kernel may assign `init` or `systemd` as the new parent to perform cleanup.
