# WEB API vs REST

Web API is a generic term for any API (Application Programming Interface) that is accessible over the web using HTTP.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a specific architectural style used to design networked applications, commonly used in Web APIs.

**Summary** :
Web API = Any API over the web (can be REST, SOAP, GraphQL, etc.)

REST = A style or set of rules for building APIs, usually using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

👉 So, REST can be a type of Web API, but not all Web APIs are RESTful.
