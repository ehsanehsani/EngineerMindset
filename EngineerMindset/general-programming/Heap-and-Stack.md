# Heap and Stack in C# - A Programmer's Guide

## Introduction

As a programmer, understanding memory allocation is key to writing efficient and bug-free code. In C#, memory is managed primarily in two regions:

- **Stack**
- **Heap**

Each plays a vital role in how data is stored, accessed, and managed in your application.

## Stack

### What is the Stack?

The **stack** is a region of memory that stores:

- Value types (e.g., `int`, `double`, `bool`)
- Method call information (e.g., parameters, return addresses)
- Local variables of value types

The stack works in a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** manner.

### Characteristics:

- Fast memory allocation and deallocation
- Managed by the system automatically
- Data has limited lifetime (based on scope)

### Example (Easy Level):

```csharp
void StackExample()
{
    int a = 10; // Stored on the stack
    int b = 20; // Stored on the stack
    int c = a + b; // Also stored on the stack
    Console.WriteLine(c);
}
```

### Stack Trace Example:

Each method call creates a new stack frame.

```csharp
void A() { B(); }
void B() { C(); }
void C() { int x = 42; }
```

In the above example, when `A()` calls `B()` and `B()` calls `C()`, a new frame is added for each call and removed once the method returns.

## Heap

### What is the Heap?

The **heap** is a region of memory used for:

- Reference types (e.g., classes, arrays, delegates)
- Data that needs to live beyond the current method or scope

Objects stored in the heap are accessed via references.

### Characteristics:

- Slower allocation compared to stack
- Managed by the **Garbage Collector** (GC)
- More flexible for dynamic data

### Example (Easy to Medium Level):

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name;
    public int Age;
}

void HeapExample()
{
    Person p = new Person(); // p is a reference on the stack
    p.Name = "Alice";        // The object is on the heap
    p.Age = 30;
    Console.WriteLine(p.Name);
}
```

Here, `p` is a reference stored on the stack, but the actual `Person` object is stored in the heap.

## Value vs Reference Types

| Type           | Memory                      | Copied When Assigned? |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Value Type     | Stack                       | Yes (by value)        |
| Reference Type | Stack (ref) + Heap (object) | No (by reference)     |

### Example:

```csharp
int x = 5;
int y = x; // Copy value

Person a = new Person();
Person b = a; // Copy reference
b.Name = "Bob";
Console.WriteLine(a.Name); // Outputs: Bob
```

## Advanced Concepts (High-Level)

### Boxing and Unboxing

Boxing: Converting a value type to a reference type (stored on the heap).  
Unboxing: Extracting the value type back.

```csharp
int num = 123;
object obj = num; // Boxing
int num2 = (int)obj; // Unboxing
```

### Stack Overflow

Occurs when too much memory is used on the stack (e.g., deep or infinite recursion).

```csharp
void Recursive() {
    Recursive();
}
```

### Garbage Collection (GC)

The .NET runtime uses GC to clean up unused objects from the heap. You can influence GC using:

```csharp
GC.Collect(); // Not recommended unless necessary
```

### Large Object Heap (LOH)

Objects over 85,000 bytes go into a special area called the Large Object Heap, which is managed separately.

### Span and stackalloc

Advanced techniques for stack-based memory operations.

```csharp
Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int[5];
numbers[0] = 10;
```

## Summary

- **Use stack** for simple, short-lived value type variables.
- **Use heap** for complex or long-lived objects.
- Understand how memory is managed to avoid performance and memory issues.

Understanding stack vs heap in C# helps you:

- Write efficient code
- Avoid memory leaks
- Understand object lifetimes and scopes
